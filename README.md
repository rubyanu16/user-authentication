Project Title:
User Authentication System

Aim:
The aim of this project is to design and implement a secure web-based User Authentication System that allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles efficiently. The system focuses on maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and security of user credentials by integrating encryption and authentication mechanisms.
This project ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources and that all sensitive information is safely stored and managed.

Features:
1.	User Registration:
   •New users can sign up by providing details such as username, email, and password.
   •Input validations ensure correct and complete data entry.
2.	User Login:
   •Registered users can securely log in with their credentials.
   •Invalid credentials trigger appropriate error messages.
3.	Password Encryption:
   o	Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage in the database.
   o	Prevents direct password visibility even to administrators.
4.	Session Management:
   o	Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to maintain active sessions securely.
   o	Protects pages from unauthorized access.
5.	Profile Management:
   o	Logged-in users can view and update their personal information.
   o	Profile data is fetched dynamically from the backend database.
6.	Logout Functionality:
   o	Users can securely log out, clearing their session data.
7.	Responsive User Interface:
   o	Frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive and user-friendly design.
8.	Error Handling:
   o	System provides real-time feedback for incorrect inputs or network errors.
9.	Scalability:
   o	The system can be easily expanded to include features like “Forgot Password”, “Email Verification”, and “Two-Factor Authentication”.

System Architecture Overview:
The User Authentication System follows a client-server model.
•	The frontend collects user inputs and sends them to the backend server through API requests.
•	The backend validates user data, encrypts passwords, and interacts with the MongoDB database for storing and retrieving information.
•	On successful login, a JWT token is generated and shared with the frontend to authorize user actions.

The User Authentication System is an essential component for most modern web applications. It ensures that only registered and authorized users can access certain features of a website or app.
In this project, when a new user registers, their data is securely stored in the database after encrypting the password using bcrypt. When the same user logs in, the credentials are verified, and a JWT token is issued for session management.
The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a simple and user-friendly interface for interaction. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles business logic and database communication with MongoDB.
This system can be deployed on cloud platforms or local servers and is designed for easy maintenance and future enhancement.

Conclusion:
The User Authentication System successfully implements a secure login and registration process. It ensures data privacy and provides a foundation for adding advanced features like OTP verification, password recovery, and role-based access control in future updates.
